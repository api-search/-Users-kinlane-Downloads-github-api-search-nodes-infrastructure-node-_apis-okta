      The Okta Zones API is a tool that allows developers to manage and
      configure the geographical regions where their Okta accounts are hosted.
      With this API, users can easily create and manage different zones to
      ensure that their data is stored and processed in the most secure and
      efficient manner possible. By using the Zones API, developers can set up
      specific rules and policies for different regions, control access to
      resources, and monitor the performance of their Okta accounts in
      real-time. Overall, the Okta Zones API provides users with the flexibility
      and control they need to optimize their Okta account settings based on
      their specific needs and requirements.
